    question: "Explain Solidity. What are the main components of a Solidity contract?",
    answer:
      "Solidity is a statically-typed, high-level programming language primarily used to write smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchain platforms. It was specifically designed to enable developers to easily create, deploy, and manage smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Solidity code is compiled to bytecode and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which ensures isolation, security, and transparency during contract execution.",

    question: "What is the difference between a public and private blockchain?",
    answer:
      "A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain network where anyone can join and participate in the network. A private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain network where only invited participants can join the network.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a smart contract?",
    answer:
      "A smart contract is a self-executing contract that is stored on the blockchain and is automatically executed when certain predefined conditions are met.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a blockchain?",
    answer:
      "A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a node?",
    answer:
      "A node is a device on a blockchain network that maintains a copy of the blockchain and keeps the network running by validating transactions and blocks.",
  },
